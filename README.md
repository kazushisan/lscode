> TypeScript's LanguageService for AI Coding Agents

## Why `lscode`?

### 🎯 Deterministic and Precise

lscode operates on TypeScript’s semantic model rather than raw text, enabling accurate analysis and edits with predictable results—making it a reliable foundation for AI coding agents.

### 🤖 Designed for AI-Driven Workflows

lscode provides an agent-friendly CLI with symbol-based addressing (`path/to/file.ts#symbol`), so AIs don't have to manage line numbers or character offsets.

### 🏗️ Built for TypeScript

lscode is built on lower-level TypeScript LanguageService APIs. Definition lookups return complete, semantically scoped code blocks—not just cursor positions—reducing unnecessary AI calls while enabling richer, context-aware operations.

## Install

```bash
npm install lscode
```

## Usage

```
lscode - TypeScript's LanguageService for AI coding agents

Usage: lscode <command> [options]

Commands:
  find-references <file#symbol>  Find all references to a symbol in a file
  get-definition <file#symbol>   Get the definition of a symbol in a file

Options:
